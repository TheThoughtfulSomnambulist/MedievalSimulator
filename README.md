I've always been interested in a medieval Game like CK3, but with a stronger focus on an extremely complicated economic, military, and political engine. It's obviously very ambitious, but a fun side project.


I will start from the ground up, so I will attempt a sort of Monte Carlo-esque beginning, and we will see how things go.
